> [!warning]
> In my note taking program, I use a few weird symbols or letter combinations (such as imp, star, think, !, &, etc) that visually spruce up my notes. For reasons I cannot change, these do not render properly on the website, so in my notes there might be bullet points that begin with such weird beginnings. This is normal.
