physical principles of electricity
- voltage — electrical force or pressure capable of moving charged particles thru conductor from one pt to another due to difference btwn points
- current — movement of electrical charge, measured in amperes (A), amt of electricity flowing
	- amps carry energy — amps kill, voltage does not

- ohm — measurement of amt of resistance
	- higher the resistance the lower the flow (↓ amp)
	- eq V=IR / voltage = current x resistance ⇒ ohms law
	- amperes varies proportionally to voltage 
	- varies inversely to resistance
- watts — unit of power, the rate at which energy is consumed
	- eq W = Volts x Amps
- alternating current — alternates between positive and negative
	- all machines other than iontophoresis
	- continuous bidirectional flow of charged particles
- direct current — always stays pos or neg and doesn't switch
	- iontophoresis

- waveforms — sinusoidal change in polarity (alternating current)
	- graphical representation of current flow over time
	- vertical rep amt of pos or neg energy
	- horizontal rep time
	- ! monophasic 
		- 1 phase per pulse
	- ! biphasic 
		- 2 phases
		- symmetrical or asymmetrical
	- described by shape — sine, square, triangular, spike
	- balanced or unbalanced
- DC — continuous unidirectional flow of charged particles (electrodes/ions) no waveform (galvanic)
- anode — positive terminal, red
	- each terminal attracts opposite ions
- cathode — negative terminal, black
	- each terminal attracts opposite ions
- iontophoresis — use repelling to send medication into skin, need to know charge of medicine because use same polarity on machine, DC

- pulsed current
	- flow of current that stops and starts
	- monophasic (unidirectional) or biphasic (bidirectional)
	- used for
		- pain relief
		- muscle contractions
		- tissue healing
		- edema control
	- brief uni/bi flow of electrons or ions separated by brief period of no flow
	- better suited for therapy than AC/DC bc ↑ comfort and ↓ ion charge buildup under electrodes
	- phase is period of on

> [[PTA 128 Procedures 1/rise time\|rise time]] — time it takes for current to move from zero to peak intensity in each phase 
> - shorter the rise time the less comfortable (ramp up)

- decay time — time it takes to move from peak intensity to zero (ramp down)

![PTA 128 Lecture 2-11 13-35-31.png|400](/img/user/Data/Storage/Images/PTA%20128%20Lecture%202-11%2013-35-31.png)

- frequency — pulse rate (cycles per second, Hz)
	- also rate or pulses per second
	- lower frequency may be felt as tapping
	- higher frequency more comfortable

>[!note|refactor hideT] 
>[[Psychology/amplitude\|amplitude]] — magnitude or strength of current

- ↑ frequency or amplitude ↑ amt of energy delievered
- phase duration — amt of time from start of current to end of either pos or neg current
- pulse duration — amt of time of combined pos and neg phases
	- more energy delivered by ↑ phase or pulse duration
- interphase (intrapulse) interval
- interpulse interval — off time
- on time — seconds when current on
- continuous — current is on during entire tx time
- intermittent (pulsed) — periods of on time, periods of off time
- acclimatization to sensation (habituation) — the body quickly adapts to consistent stimulation, the same amt of energy is less noticeable and less effective over time
	- can turn up intensity of e stim if pt not feeling it unless heat/cold is on with it
	- only turn up intensity on continuous mode, then switch to pulsed mode if desired
- burst AC — alternating grouping of pulses followed by no pulses
- amplitude modulated AC — changing the amplitude during each phase or during the cycle
- ramp up — ↑ amplitude from zero to peak during a burst, longer ramp more comfortable

electrodes
- the link between pt and electrotherapeutic device
- ! surface (transcutaneous) — what we use
- ! invasive (percutaneous)
- may need pt to shave or cut hair so electrode adheres
- biologic capacitor — 2 electrodes attached to skin creates current flow of ions in biologic tissues
- AC v DC
- type self adhesive — reusable, only for the same pt
- type flexible carbon — reusable, multiple pts
- dispersive pad for iontophoresis to ground electrodes must be larger than active electrode
- material — flexible, durable, good conductor
- skin surface must be cleaned
- size — dependent on body part
	- smaller electrodes more concentrated
- secure attachment ensures proper current density
	- ensure good contact — ↑ in contact during tx will result in sudden ↑ in delivered energy
- arrangement — depends on goal of intervention
	- not laying on top of an electrode
	- can arrange posterior and anterior if needed
	- deeper penetration of energy occurs w wider placement of electrodes
		- wide = deeper
		- close = shallow
- safety
	- prevent electrical shock — current levels flow into electrotherapeutic device from electric line
		- hospital grade 3 prong plug
	- GFCI — additional protection against shock
	- regular inspection by technicians

![PTA 128 Lecture 2-11 14-12-24.png|734x259](/img/user/Data/Storage/Images/PTA%20128%20Lecture%202-11%2014-12-24.png)

effects of electrotherapeutic effects
- chemical
	- electrochemical effect — electric current passes thru skin and ion accumulation occurs
	- body responds to changes in pH levels
	- blistering or chemical burns of skin
	- DC has most chemical effects
	- pulsed has least chemical effects
	- anode (positive) — Cl + H2O = HCL, weak hydrochloric acid
		- coagulation of proteins, sclerosis, hardens tissues
	- cathode (negative) — Na + H2) = H2 + NaOH, sodium hydroxide base
		- liquefaction of proteins, sclerolysis, softens tissues
- thermal
	- movement of charged particles through conductor causes microvibration + friction = energy release (heat)
- physical
	- electrokinetic effect
	- most important effect of intervention
	- cuases movement of charged particles in tissues
	- depolarization of peripheral nerve to cause gaiting (gate theory) or opioid release or to cause contraction of innervated muscle
	- devervated mm can be stimulated — more energy required

nerves and mm are excitable bc they can produce action potential and have a resting membrane potential
![PTA 128 Lecture 2-11 14-23-49.png|300x200](/img/user/Data/Storage/Images/PTA%20128%20Lecture%202-11%2014-23-49.png)

action potential
- basic unit of nerve communication
- achieved by rapid nerve or mm depolarization and repolarization in response to stimulation — usually stimulation is neurotransmitter
- depolarization starts when Na+ gate opens and Na+ flows into cell
- switches polarity inside and outside cell
- repolarization follows as permeability to sodium ↓, causing K+ channels and potassium to flow out

strength duration curve
- graphic rep of min combination of current strength (amplitude) and pulse duration needed to depolarize nerve
- interplay of pulse duration and amplitude is basis for specificity of effect of e stim
- low current amps and shorter pulse durations can depolarize sensory nerves
	-  80 microseconds pulses produce sensory stimulation only — gate theory
- higher amp or longer pulses needed to depolarize motor nerves
	- 150 to 350 microsecond pulses produce muscle contractions
	- C fibers depolarize w high amp long pulse duration — keep pulse durations below 1 microsecond, pain minimized bc C fibers not depolarized
	- pulse greater than 10 millisecond required to produce muscle contraction in denervated muscle
- when current amp and pulse duration fall below curve for particular nerve type, stimulation considered subthreshold and no response occurs
- ↑ current amp or pulse duration beyond sufficient to stimulate action potential will not change action potential
- all nerve action potentials are same — all-or-nothing
- same action potential occurs with any stimulus above threshold, no AP with any stimulus below threshold
- current amp must rise quickly for an AP to be triggered
	- if current rises too slwoly nerve will adjust to stimulus
- once AP generated, triggers AP to adjacent nerves
	- conduction/propagation of AP along neuron
- with normal physiological stimulation, AP propagation occurs only one direction
- with electrically stimulated APs, propagation occurs both ways
	- only those transmitted in usual physiological direction have effect
- spped of AP propagation varies depending on nerve fiber type and myelination
	- larger diameter of nerve fiber = ↑ speed of propagation
	- smaller diameter slower
- saltatory conduction
	- AP travel faster in myelinated nerves bc of nodes of Ranvier
- muscle depolarization
	- denervated muscles will respond to long pulses of electricity lasting for 10 milliseconds or longer by depolarizing muscle cell membrane directly
	- slow rising stimulus can be used bc mm membrane does not accomodate
- most e stim can cause mm contraction
- ↑ in pulse duration is primary key to mm contraction, ↑ amplitude is secondary

therapeutic effects of electrotherapy
- mm strengthening
- mm retraining for motor control
- pain control
- enhancement of circulation
- inhibition and reduction of edema
- enhancement of tissue healing

e stim contras
- general
	- big 5
	- transthoracic (front to back)
	- transcranial
	- electronic implants
	- unstable arrhythmias
	- over carotid sinus
	- DVT
- when causing mm contraction
	- active bleeding 
	- when active contraction contraindicated
- precautions
	- allergies to tape, adhesives, alcohol
	- cardiac disease
	- over skin irritation or open wound
	- metal

pulse width and pulse duration are the same

informed consent
- turn up just to tingle
- contraction — turn up until mm stands up
- it might be a little uncomfortable but we'll stop if it becomes too uncomfortable
